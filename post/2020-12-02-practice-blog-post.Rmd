Using R studio is wonderful because you can use **reticulate** to integrate code from R with Python. This is shown below:

```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
x <- 100
```

```{python}
#Python code chunk
x = 3
print(r.x * x)
```

Isn't that neat?? 
Python is also easy to use as a calculator because you can always return the last thing evaluated using '_'. For example:

```{python}
x + 1
_ * 2
```

Another unique aspect of Python is that it can be used to carry out multiple assignment. In other words, rather than having to assign a single variable at a time, you can assign multiple variables simultaneously. This is shown below:
```{python}
a, b = x+1, x*x
a
b
```
